##What Is Advanced Search?

Advanced Search adds robust options to Vanilla’s native search to help users hunt down specific content in your community. It is available on corporate level plans and above. If your account is at the appropriate level, the plugin can be toggled on from the addon menu in the Dashboard.

##Using Advanced Search

Navigating to /search will bring you to a page with an expandable search-bar. Clicking the arrow on the right side of the bar will show you all the extra parameters you now have for search:

By default, users will only see these options on the /search page, but you can switch out the search bar on your homepage to have expanded options. Simply change out {searchbox} for {searchbox_advanced} in your custom theme. 

Advanced search also enables an autocomplete function that pulls results as you type.

If you are looking for something very specific, there are some additional parameters you can use to help narrow down results.

“keyword phrase”: A phrase wrapped in quotes must occur in that order.
+keyword: The keyword must occur in the search result.
-keyword: The keyword must not occur in the result.
