##What Is Q&A for?

Using Vanilla for support builds a searchable collection of solutions for your users. Users generate questions in an area where they can get help from staff or their fellow members. The archives become invaluable self-serve support as the best answers are chosen. QnA was built with support communities in mind, the plugin adds essential features to manage tickets and respond to your users quickly. 

##Enabling and Using Q&A 

The plugin can be enabled from the dashboard on any plan level, you can find it in the list of addons by searching for Q&A. Once it’s enabled, it will add an option to the “New Discussion” drop down on your forum:

Creating a question will create status labels in the discussion view.

Users will receive pop-up notifications when their questions have new comments, prompting them to mark a post as the solution. 

By default, the selected answer will be pulled out of the post order and pinned directly under the original post for easy access. This behavior can be modified with a support request, allowing the post to be duplicated instead of being completely reordered. 

In your side navigation, you’ll notice a new option:

Navigating to /discussions/unanswered will allow you to see all the questions that still need attention in your community. 

You can set the ability to create questions with category permissions. When creating or editing a category, check the option “This category has custom permissions.” This will reveal the “Discussion Type” options.

You can choose to disable discussions in a category, which will change the “New Discussion” button into “Ask a Question” in that particular section. If you’d like for “Ask a Question” to be default forum wide, you can request for us to toggle the option through support. 

Discussions that have already been created can be changed into questions by Moderators and Admins. Simply use the cogwheel menu on a post, and select Q&A:
